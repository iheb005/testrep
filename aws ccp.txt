* what is cloud computing ? :
using a network of remote servers hosted on internet to store, manage and process data, rather than a local server or a PC

** on-premise: you own the servers, hire IT people to configure them, pay or rent the real-estate and you take all the risk
** Cloud providers: SO else owns the servers, hire the IT people ,pays/rent the  real estate, you're responsible for your configuring cloud services and code, SO else takes care of the rest

* Cloud Computing advs:
1/ trade capital expense for variable expense: pay on-demand when consuming computing rss instead of paying for data centers/servers
2/ benefit from massive economies of scale: share cost with other customers
3/ stop guessing capacities: scalablity to meet the current need(increase /decrease depending on your need), instead of paying for idle/underutilized servers
4/increase speed and agility : launch rss in few mins instead of waiting for days/weeks to implement the solution on-premise.
5/ stop waisting money on running/maintaining data centers
6/apps deployment easily in few mins in multiple regions around the world --> low latency, better exp for clients at minimal costs.

*Types of Cloud Computing:
1/ SaaS for customers : a completed product run and managed by the service provider (gmail, office365)
2/ PaaS for developers: no need to manage the underlying infra, just focus on the deployment of your app (heroku, AWS elastic Beanstalk...)
3/IaaS for admins : acces to networking features, computers and data storage space( microsoft azure, google cloud platform, aws)

*Cloud concepts:
cloud deployment models:
- cloud: fully utlizing cloud computing(dropbox) used for SaaS offerings in startups(low cost), new projects and companies (lack of infrastructure) 
- hybrid: using both cloud and on-premise used for banks, large pro service providers
- on-premise: deploy rss on-premises, using virtualization and rss managment tools called private cloud (public sector gov,super sensitive data eg:hospitals, 

*AWS global infra:
cloud computing is running in 69 availability zones within 22 geographic regions around the world, it serves over 1M active customers on more than 190 countries

** regions: geographically ditinct location which has multiple datacenters, it is phisically isolated and has at least 2 AZ(availability zones), the largest region is US-EAST(all new services almost become always become available in us-EAST).
not all services are available in all regions

** avalability zones: 
- AZ: datacenter owned and operated by AWS in which aws services run, represented by a region code + letter identifier (eg: us-east-1a,b,c...)
- Multi-AZ: distribute instances across multiple AZs helps to handle req when one goes down.
latency between AZs < 10ms

*Edge locations: dacenter owned by a trusted partner of aws and has a direct cocnnection with the aws network, get data fast or upload fast to aws, it allows content distribution to reduce latency for end users no matter the geo location.

27.40
*GovCloud regions: allow customers to host sensitive controlled unclassified info.
